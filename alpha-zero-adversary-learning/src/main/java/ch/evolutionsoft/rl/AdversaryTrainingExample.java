/**
 * An {@link AdversaryTrainingExample} is generated by self play and consists
 * of the board state, action probabilities currentPlayer max or min, the
 * current player value after played until end and iteration for debug analysis.
 *  
 * Two {@link AdversaryTrainingExample} are considered equals when they have 
 * the same board state. Existing {@link AdversaryTrainingExample} with a given
 * board state can get replaced with new action probabilities in {@link AdversaryLearning}.
 * 
 * The currentPlayer here is the player with the next move. The currentPlayerValue is
 * 1 if the last trainingExample path lead to a win for currentPlayer 
 * Game.MAX_PLAYER or Game.MIN_PLAYER. The currentPlayerValue alternates from 1 to 0 and
 * back along a number of {@link AdversaryTrainingExample} from the same self play with
 * one end result. In the case of a draw currentPlayerValue is 0.5 for all examples.
